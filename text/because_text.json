		"clutter" : ["Clutter sucks. It takes up space, is ugly, and reduces efficiency. But what exactly is clutter? Clutter is anything that is not positioned to perform at peak capacity. For example, a laundry basket is a messy conglomeration of dirty clothes. However, if all your dirty clothes are there, both the basket and your dirty clothes are not clutter (they are performing at a desired capacity). On the flip side, a single pencil on the floor is clutter because it’s not positioned to be useful.","The most damaging type of clutter is mental. Similar to dirty laundry, if thoughts are strewn around your head, your mind can’t perform at peak capacity. To improve mental efficiency, I try to meditate and journal every day. I also will never start working unless I have created a to-do list with time estimates for each task. Thanks to internet research and tons of trial and error, I am proud to report mental efficiency as one of my most improved traits."],
		"improvement" : ["Here’s some math: if you improve by 1% every day, after one year you will be about 37 times better. So, it seems like a no-brainer to improve consistently at the highest level possible. I also find few things more rewarding than achieving a demanding goal.","Every project I tackle incorporates an area of myself that I want to improve. For instance, I used to struggle with creating products in a timely manner (I always got lost in the details). One day, after spending 45 minutes aligning the footer text of an otherwise empty website, I realized this pace was not sustainable. After some research, I decided that my attitude for future projects would be to create a minimum viable product (MVP) for everything, and fill in the gaps later. By using this strategy, I can now happily say that efficiency is one of my strengths."],
		"money" : ["Do you ever wish you could do two things at once? Same. That’s why I’m love “making money while I sleep” (sometimes literally). Now, this concept always takes one of two forms: delegating (to humans) or automating (through computers). Personally, I am more interested in automation because with a little initial work, you can have a free and very efficient personal assistant.","My first experiment with automation was an NBA lineup predictor that web-scraped data to forecast Draftkings lineups. The entire program took several months to build, but once it was created, I could get a winning lineup in under 20 minutes."]
