		"improvement" : "If you’re not improving, what the hell are you doing with your life? Now, just like a stock, you don’t have to improve every day, but your trend better be bullish. My favorite way to improve is by learning a new skill. With virtually every project I take on, I try to develop some technical competence so that by building something awesome, I get better. Recently, I have been experimenting with non-technical projects, such as meditation, journaling, and morning workouts. With these non-technical projects, instead of having an algorithm or a product as tangible proof of my growth, I instead have my mind and my body. ",
